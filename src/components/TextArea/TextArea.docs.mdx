# TextArea

Better looking alternative to native HTML textarea

## Basic usage

<Playground>
    <TextArea />
</Playground>

## Placeholder

<Playground>
    <TextArea placeholder="Zadejte..." />
</Playground>

## Full width

<Playground>
    <TextArea isFullWidth />
</Playground>

## Disable

<Playground>
    <TextArea isDisabled />
</Playground>

## Resize

<Playground>
    <TextArea allowResize />
</Playground>

## Known bugs

-   `size` does not work
-   `isDisabled` makes the component look like its disabled, but it is not => you can write into
